# nagios-check-template

## Scope (Why?)

I use nagios as much as the next sysadmin. I can never seem to remember
the basic template, so here it is. I've started one, and I'll probably
add more over time. But this is my basic one.

## Development

Pull requests are very welcome! Make sure your patches are well tested.
Ideally create a topic branch for every separate change you make. For
example:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Run the tests and rubocop, `bundle exec rake spec` and `bundle exec rake rubocop`
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
6. Create new Pull Request
